### 🪞 Reflection (STAR Technique)
**Situation:** As part of my Work Readiness Training, I completed a Career Development Assessment to evaluate my alignment with 
               potential roles in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) field.  
               
**Task:**     The goal was to gain clarity about my strengths, interests, and how they match the expectations and career paths 
              available within the ICT industry, specifically in Application Development.
              
**Action:**  I took the assessment seriously, responding thoughtfully to questions related to technical aptitude, problem- 
             solving, 
             preferred work environments, and interpersonal skills. After reviewing the results, I consulted with a career 
             advisor 
             to interpret the feedback and explore how it relates to my academic journey and future opportunities.

**Result:** The assessment revealed that my strongest areas include logical reasoning, software development, and communication— 
            qualities essential in the ICT sector. It confirmed that my interests align well with roles like software developer, 
            systems analyst, or project coordinator. This insight gave me more confidence in my career path, motivated me to 
            improve specific technical skills, and helped me understand how the faculty of ICT at CPUT prepares students for 
            industry demands.

           specifically in the field of Application Development.


**Action:** I completed assessments and exercises to improve technical abilities (problem-solving, programming logic, and 
            database administration) as well as soft skills (communication, teamwork, and time management). I also looked at job 
            descriptions and career pathways within the ICT faculty to determine if my qualifications matched industry 
            expectations.

### 🪞 Reflection (STAR Technique)
**Situation:**  As part of the work readiness training, I completed a personality test to better understand my behaviour, work 
                preferences, and interpersonal style. 
                
**Task:**      Used the personality results to identify how I fit within team environments and the ICT work culture.

  
**Action:**    The assessment revealed that I am an introverted, thoughtful, and detail-oriented person (e.g., INFJ or ISTJ). I 
               reviewed the findings and considered how they affect collaboration, leadership, and communication in a tech- 
               focused workplace.
               
**Result:**    The Personality assessment showed me areas to improve, such as being more assertive in team discussions and
